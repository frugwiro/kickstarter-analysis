Kickstarting with Excel Project
 
1.	Overview of Project
This project will cover how excel was used to help Louise determine the best option to pursue and guide for her crowdfunding play campaign in order to be successful. This will be achieved by comparing her crowdfunding to the data outcome of other similar crowdfunding campaigns.

2.	Purpose
The purpose of this project is to help Luoise who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play, ‘Fever’. Using current site data from Kickstarter; excel will be used to organize, sort, and analyze to determine whether there are specific factors that make Louise project's campaign decisions from start to finish successful.

3.	Analysis and Challenges
The challenges for this project are to make sure our analytics exactly mirror the crowdfunding data outcomes, and make it easier for most people, especially Louise to view and understand better what data means before starting her crowdfunding campaign. 

4.	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
The line graph below compares every crowdfunding campaign outcome based on launch month to determine the best month to start a crowdfunding campaign. Outcome based on the launch date shows that May is the best month to launch a crowdfunding campaign. May has by far the most successful crowdfunding campaigns with almost 250 crowdfunding successful, followed by February with 200 crowdfunding campaigns successful.

5.	Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The line graph below compares the outcomes based on crowdfunding total dollar amount goal. Goal amount between $4500 to $4999 has up to 100 failed crowdfunding campaigns, while the goal of less than $1000 was the most successful with almost 80 crowdfunding campaigns achieving success.

6.	Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
The biggest challenge and difficulty encouraged was to write a formula that determines the number of successful/failed/canceled crowdfunding campaigns. 

7.	Results
Based on dataset analytics results, the conclusion is that the best month to launch a crowdfunding campaign is first in May, followed by February from figure 4.1. Furthermore, the data analysis from figure 5.1, shows that the most successful outcomes based on goals are the goals under $15000, followed by goals between $35000 to $45000. 
The limitation of this dataset might be limited sample size, self-reported data that might be fraudulent, missing data, and deficiencies in data measurement.
Theater outcomes by launch data, parent category outcome, descriptive Statistics, and Edinburgh Research are some of the graphs that could have been created.
